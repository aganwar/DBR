Filtering & baseline
User story
As a resource manager,
When I open the “Scheduled Resource” page,
I want the filter funnel to list all resource groups,
So I can quickly choose what I want to plan.
Acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
•	Given the page has loaded, When I click the funnel icon, Then a filter dialog opens showing all groups with a “Select all” option.
•	Given I select one or more groups and click “Apply filter”, Then the Master grid shows only resources from those groups.
•	Given filters are applied, When I click “Clear filter”, Then both the Master grid and Calendar grid clear their rows but keep their column headers visible.

Master grid — selection drives calendar
User story
As a resource manager,
When I select a single resource in the Master grid,
I want the Calendar grid to load that resource’s schedule,
So I can plan its capacity by day.
Acceptance criteria
•	Given one resource row is selected, When the selection changes, Then the Calendar grid fetches data for that resource (keeping current date range).
•	Given no resource is selected, Then the Calendar grid shows only headers (no rows).

Master grid — inline edit, batch save, cancel
User story
As a resource manager,
When I edit capacity or “Is Constraint” in the Master grid,
I want visual feedback and a safe way to commit or discard,
So I can batch my changes confidently.
Acceptance criteria
•	Given I edit a cell, Then that cell is highlighted light green if valid, or light red if invalid.
•	Given there are valid edits, Then “Save” is enabled; When I click “Save”, Then changes persist and highlights clear.
•	Given any invalid edit exists, Then “Save” is disabled until I fix or cancel those edits.
•	Given I click “Cancel” (always enabled), Then the Master grid refreshes from the server, preserves the current filters and reselects the previous row if it still exists, and clears highlights.

Calendar grid — range, inline edit, batch save, cancel
User story
As a resource manager,
When I adjust the date range,
I want the Calendar grid to reload within that range,
So I can focus on the right planning window.
Acceptance criteria
•	Given quick range buttons (This week / Next 7 / Next week / This month / All), When I click one, Then the Calendar grid refetches for the selected resource within that range.
•	Given I edit a day’s capacity or off-day flag, Then the edited cell shows green if valid or red if invalid; off-day ON forces capacity to 0.
•	Given valid edits exist and no invalid cells, Then “Save” is enabled; When I click “Save”, Then the grid PATCHes the server, refetches, and clears highlights.
•	Given I click “Cancel” (always enabled), Then the Calendar grid refetches for the same resource and range, preserving selection and clearing highlights.

Clear filter — resets both grids
User story
As a resource manager,
When I click “Clear filter” in the funnel dialog,
I want both grids to clear their data (not headers),
So I can start a new planning selection.
Acceptance criteria
•	Given filters were applied, When I click “Clear filter”, Then the Master grid shows no rows and the Calendar grid shows no rows for any previous selection.

Validation & guardrails
User story
As a resource manager,
When I input values,
I want immediate validation feedback,
So I don’t save bad data.
Acceptance criteria
•	Capacity accepts null/empty or a finite number ≥ 0.
•	Invalid inputs show a red background; Save is disabled until fixed or canceled.
•	Off-day toggle is always valid; when turned on, capacity auto-sets to 0.

Persistence of state on cancel
User story
As a resource manager,
When I change my mind mid-edit,
I want Cancel to refresh from the server but keep my context,
So I don’t lose my filters or selection.
Acceptance criteria
•	Master grid Cancel: preserves current group filter + reselection if the row still exists.
•	Calendar grid Cancel: preserves selected resource + current date range.
•	In both grids, all unsaved highlights/edits are dropped.

Layout & responsiveness
User story
As a resource manager,
When I resize the browser,
I want both grids to stretch from header to bottom,
So I can use the available screen estate.
Acceptance criteria
•	Grid containers occupy the vertical space between the header bar and the window bottom.
•	Column headers remain visible even when there are no rows.
________________________________________
Non-functional
•	Save/Cancel remain in the grid headers (top) for both grids.
•	Button labels: This week / Next 7 / Next week / This month / All / Save / Cancel.
•	Visual feedback colors: light green for valid edits, light red for invalid edits.
•	Cancel is always enabled in both grids.

When you share your detailed workflow, I’ll slot it into this structure, expand acceptance criteria (including specific API calls and example payloads), and align any edge cases you want covered.
